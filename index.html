<h1> Twitter Data - Analysis </h1>
<h2> Preliminaries </h2>

<ul>
 <li> My very first step is to re-format the 15K Tweepy status objects in "./data/ml_tweets.bin" into a CSV file. </li>
 <li> Code: "python data_format.py data/ml_tweets.bin"  </li> 
</ul >


<h3> Tweeting frequency : spread over time and user-space </h3>

    <ul> Code : "python data_characteristics.py"  to produce the following two files </ul> 
    <table style="width:75%">  
            <tr> <td> <img src="data/tweet_frequency_monthly.jpg " alt="--", width="75%"> </td>    </tr>
            <tr> <td> <img src="data/tweet_frequency_user_wise.jpg " alt="--", width="75%"> </td>    </tr>
    </table>


    <ul> 
        <li> The temporal spread is too skewed. Almost all of the tweets are from the past 2 months, discouraging trend-analysis </li>
        <li> We can see check for some user-follower-insights</li>
    </ul>

   <table style="width:75%">  
            <tr> <td> <img src="data/followers.jpg " alt="--", width="75%"> </td>    </tr>
    </table>


    <ul> 
        <li> Hillary Mason has nearly 11K followers. Contrast that with 50K followers for the Stanford NLP group.!!! </li>
        <li> An explanation is <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Hilary-Mason-a-prominent-figure-within-the-big-data-community-What-are-her-notable-accomplishments"> here </a> </li>
    </ul>



<h2> NLP analysis </h2>
    <p>
    If there is more of historical data, tweets can be analysed for trends in hashtag usage, topic evolution, language changes..etc.
    From a linguistic angle, topic discovery is the most interesting. After experimenting, I settled with the number of topics as 6. 
    Looking at the words associated with these topics, they are most likely to be :
    </p>
    
     <l>
     <li> Topic 0: Videos/Graphics. Main keywords: play, hardmaru. </li>
     <li> Topic 1: Discussion.  Tweets of this kind seem to be general discussion, talking about Visa issues in conferences and othe general aspects. Main keywords: think, really good, idea</li>
     <li> Topic 2: ML community news. Mostly mailing-list announcements. Main keywords: neural, example, application, science </li>
     <li> Topic 3: NLP :  Quite similar to topic 2, but NLP focussed. Some popular nlp forums driving these. Main keywords: nlproc, stanfordnlp  </li>
     <li> Topic 4: Google-related:  Mainly announcements related to new developments around Tensorflow. Main keywords: spacy, tensorflow, release,support  </li>
     <li> Topic 5: Academic : There is a higher presence of academic news, driven by ICML conference announcements and academic openings. Main keywords: great, talk, paper, post, student </li>
    </l >

    
        <p>Topic discovery - being an unsupervised problem requires considerable manual examination to fine tune the process. LDA might not be best suited for short-texts such as tweets and further experimentation with other methods such as TF-IDF based clustering.  Entity-recognition for standard concepts like person, organization etc showed less accuracy - perhaps because a dataset-specific trained model is not yet available. Training such a model requires more experimentation/annotation support as well. Below is an illustration that shows the topics on which a user mostly tweets about.  </p>

    <table style="width:75%">  
            <tr> <td> <img src="data/User_to_topic_association.jpg" alt="--", width="120%"> </td>    </tr>
    </table>


    <p>Summary  </p>
        <ul>
        <li> Dataset is temporally skewed -- most tweets being from past 2 months -- is not conducive for temporal or trend analysis</li>
        <li> The follower count analysis was interesting and helped discover the leaders of the community such as Hillary Mason</li>
        <li> Topic discovery showed some interesting insights such as the strong associations such as (Google-Related, Tensorflow)  and
            (Academic, icmlconf). A surprising observations is the weak association in (Videos/Graphics, Tensorflow). More manual analysis is needed to explain these phenomenon.
      <li> The next step is to find the relation between hashtags and the discovered topics from tweet-text. This is is going to be helpful in interpreting a popular hashtag subjectively, for latent inherent concepts that drive it.  </li>
    </ul>
